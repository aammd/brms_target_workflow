```{r}
library(targets)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```


## Goal

to create a workflow for validating brms models using a targets pipeline

the idea is to use the tools already in brms and `targets` to automate this useful and common task.

* define a model using `brms` syntax
* simulate out of the prior using `brms`
* for each (of some sample of) prior simulation, fit the model 
* does the parameter estimate cover the real value?

## plotting

here is an example of some simulated datasets

```{r}
tar_load(prior_predictive_draws)

prior_predictive_draws |> 
  head() |> 
  unnest(simulated_data) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y = epred)) + 
  facet_wrap(~draw_id)
```

And here is the coverage for the different intervals:

```{r}
tar_load(coverage)

knitr::kable(coverage)
```
